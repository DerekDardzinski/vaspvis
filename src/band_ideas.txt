# What is needed?

* Plain Band structure
    * Nothing specieal needed
    ********* DONE ***********

* Projected Band structure on s,p,d for all atoms and orbitals
    * s, p, and d orbitals are all summed for each atom. 
    * s = 0, p = 1, 2, 3, d = 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 
    * Name (plot_spd)
    ********* DONE ***********

* Projected Band structure on individual atoms (Surface atoms / interface)
    * Find surface atoms and sum their weights across all orbitals
    * Only one color will be necessary
    * Name (show_surface_atoms)

* Projected Band structure on individual atoms with orbitals
    * Most customized ploting option
    * Name (plot_atom_orbitals)

* Projected Band structure on certain orbitals (px vs py, s vs dxx, etc.)
    * User supplys orbitals, and they are summed across all atoms
    * Each orbital gets a different color for comparison
    * Name (compare_orbitals)

* Project on certain elements and compare (In vs Sb)
    * Element symbols are input and all atom indices are found and summed (from POSCAR)
    * Each element gets a different color
    * Name (compare_elements)
